We made a subset only consisting of label_tissue and the methylation data and only the samples containing cancer.
```{r}

  
df_imputed <- subset(df_imputed, select = -label_title)
df_methylation <- subset(df_methylation, select = -label_gender)
df_methylation <- subset(df_methylation, select = -label_age)
df_methylation <- subset(df_methylation, select = -label_disease)
df_methylation <- subset(df_methylation, select = -label_clinical_stage)
df_methylation <- subset(df_methylation, select = -label_site_label)
df_methylation <- subset(df_methylation, select = -label_source_of_sample)



df_methylation <- df_methylation[-(1:38), ]

```
next, we saved the csv dataset on our computer to acces it via python
```{r}
write.csv(df_methylation, "redbull.csv", row.names = FALSE)
getwd()

```
