We made a subset only consisting of label_tissue and the methylation data
```{r}
#
  
df_imputed <- subset(df_imputed, select = -label_title)
df_methylation <- subset(df_methylation, select = -label_gender)
df_methylation <- subset(df_methylation, select = -label_age)
df_methylation <- subset(df_methylation, select = -label_disease)
df_methylation <- subset(df_methylation, select = -label_clinical_stage)
df_methylation <- subset(df_methylation, select = -label_site_label)
df_methylation <- subset(df_methylation, select = -label_source_of_sample)



df_methylation <- df_methylation[-(1:38), ]

```
