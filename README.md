# Group-6-project-LSABD-2025-2026
Project Overview

This repository contains the code, notebooks, and results for the LSABD group project (2025–2026).
The goal of this project is to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, multivariate analysis, and machine learning on the provided datasets.
All analyses are presented in executed notebooks, including figures and outputs, so no rerunning is required for evaluation.

## Data Availability

Due to file size limitations, the original datasets are not included in this GitHub repository.
The data were provided through the course platform.
All preprocessing steps and the generation of derived datasets are fully implemented in the code.
For more details, see data/README.md.

## Notebooks and Results

All notebooks in the notebooks/ directory are provided in an executed state and contain:
- all intermediate results
- figures and visualizations
- final outputs

This allows the project to be evaluated without rerunning any code or accessing the original datasets.

## Code

The code/ directory contains the scripts used for:
- data preprocessing
- univariate and multivariate analysis
- machine learning
Both R and Python were used, depending on the analysis task.


All results are visible directly in the notebooks
